/*
 * The only methods that are implemented for you are the While statement and a Not expression.
 * Use those two as a template. At the end of this analysis, each expression node should have a
 * valid LatticeElem associated with it.
 *
 * Overview of the code below:
 *
 *
 * LatticeElem:
 *   To see how to work with LatticeElem and LatticeElemMaps, open "attribute.hpp"
 *
 *   In short, LatticeElem is a class that stores a number, a value of a particular
 *   variable or stored in a node. You can just assign a number to it, or TOP or BOTTOM.
 *
 *   For example, to make an expression's value constant, you go:
 *     p -> m_attribute.m_lattice_elem = 5; -// or TOP or BOTTOM
 *
 *   LatticeElems can be compared to each other or to integers using the == operator. If you
 *   specifically need to access a LatticeElem's constant value, use it's public "value" field:
 *     int value = p -> m_attribute.m_lattice_elem.value;
 *
 *
 * LatticeElemMap:
 *   It is nothing but a map of type std::map<const char*, LatticeElem>
 *   http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map
 *
 *   In short, you can just lookup a value using the [] operator with a char* as the
 *   argument representing the name of a variable. That will return the corresponding
 *   LatticeElem for a variable name; and if that variable was not stored in the map,
 *   its entry will be automatically added with value BOTTOM.
 *
 *   So, to lookup a LatticeElem in a LatticeElemMap *map, under a Symname "symname":
 *     LatticeElem &le = (*in)[symname->spelling()];
 *
 *   To store a value in the map you similarily go:
 *     (*in)[p->m_symname->spelling()] = TOP;
 *
 *   To clone a LatticeElemMap use a copy constructor. Look at the While statement for
 *   an example.
 *
 *   To JOIN one LatticeElemMap with another, call the join_lattice_maps() function. Example
 *   in the While statement implementation. Note that this function alters the 1st argument
 *   map to contain the join! 
 *
 * 
 * This visitor pattern is not as simple as the typecheck visitor.
 *
 * Each visit method receives an "in" LatticeElemMap, containing the information about variable states
 * from before the visit. You're supposed to edit this LatticeElemMap according to the rules of our constant
 * propagation and return it in the end.
 *
 * In addition, all Expression type nodes have a LatticeElem associated with them. This is the value of the
 * expression as determined by the analysis; by default, it's BOTTOM. You should set all these to either
 * constants, if the analysis can guarantee that an expression will be constant, or to TOP if the analysis 
 * cannot guarantee that an expression will be a constant. This LatticeElem can be accessed, for an expression node *p:
 *   p->m_attribute.m_lattice_elem
 *
 * To recursivelly do the analysis on all the children of a node, use "out = visit_children_of(node, in);"
 * Each child's "out" LatticeElemMap is propagated to the next child as it "in"; the last "out" is returned.
 *  
 * To visit a single child, use "out = visit(child_node, in);". To visit a child that is a list of nodes, use
 * "out = visit_list(list, in);" and the in/out sets are propagated between the individual elements.
 *
 *
 * The rules of our constant folding are:
 *   * All variables are uninitialized at the beginning of a function (TOP by default)
 *   * All assignments force the left hand side variable to the value of the right hand side
 *   * We are doing an intraprocedural analysis. This means that we do our analysis for each function
 *     separately, not minding other functions. As a consequence:
 *       + We assume each function always returns TOP. We will not assume anything more precise.
 *       + We don't assume anything about global variables; therefore they're (initially) TOP, and nothing one function
*         does to a global affects the same global in other functions.
*       + We assume that any function may alter any visible var's state. To simplify the analysis ALL variables should 
*         be set to TOP after each call statement.
*   * We are not keeping track of IntArrays. Any array element is assumed to be TOP at all times.
* Also:
*   * Anything multiplied by 0 is 0
*   * Dividing 0 by anything is always 0, and dividing anything by 0 makes the result 0 for this assignment
*   * false AND anything is false, true OR anything is true
*
* While it is possible to do a more detailed analysis, that is not allowed in order to keep the grading fair. If you have 
* a good idea about doing a more precise analysis, great, talk to us about it, but for this assignment do exactly the 
* analysis posted here; no more and no less.
