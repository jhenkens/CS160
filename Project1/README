I first made my grammar unambigious, then made it LL(1). I implemented this directly 
in calc.cpp, and then went about creating the calculator portion. Unfortunately, my
first grammar was right associative, so I had to modify my grammar, which I did in
calc_def.y, to make it left associative. Once I changed the grammar, I changed my
implementation in calc.cpp to evaluate the expressions with left associativity.

To my knowledge, all parts of the project are working correctly.
